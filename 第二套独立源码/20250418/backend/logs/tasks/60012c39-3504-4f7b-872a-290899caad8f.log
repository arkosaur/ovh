The conditions into\nwhich OVHcloud processes, as a Controller, Personal Data relating to the Client (including the\nClient’s agents), are defined in the OVHcloud Data Usage Policy.\nFor the purpose of this DPA, the Client may act either as “Controller” or “Processor” with respect\nto Personal Data. If the Client is acting as a processor on behalf of a third-party Controller, the Parties\nexpressly agree to the following conditions:\n(a) The Client shall ensure that (i) all the necessary authorisations to enter into this DPA,\nincluding the Client’s appointment of OVHcloud as sub-processor, have been obtained from\nthe Controller, (ii) an agreement, that is fully consistent with the terms and conditions of the\nAgreement including this DPA, has been entered into with the Controller pursuant to the said\narticle 28 of the GDPR, (iii) any instructions received by OVHcloud from the Client in execution\nof the Agreement and this DPA are fully consistent with the Controller’s instruction and (iv)\nall the information communicated or made available by OVHcloud pursuant to this DPA is\nappropriately communicated to the Controller as necessary;\n(b) OVHcloud shall (i) process Personal Data only under the Client’s instruction and (ii) not\nreceive any instruction directly from the Controller, except in cases where the Client has\nfactually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law without any successor entity taking on the\nrights and obligation of the Client;\n(c) The Client, which is fully responsible to OVHcloud for the proper execution of the obligations\nof the Controller as provided under this DPA, shall indemnify and hold OVHcloud harmless\nagainst (i) any failure of the Controller to comply with applicable law, and (ii) any action,\nclaim or complaint from the Controller concerning the provisions of the Agreement\n(including this DPA) or any instruction received by OVHcloud from the Client.\n\n1\n\n1. Scope\n1.1 OVHcloud is authorised, as a Processor acting under Client’s instruction, to process the\nController’s Personal Data to the extent necessary to provide the Services.\n1.2 The nature of operations carried out by OVHcloud on Personal Data may be computing, storage\nand/or any such other Services as described in the Agreement.\n1.3 The type of Personal Data and the categories of Data Subjects are determined and controlled by\nthe Client, at its sole discretion.\n1.4 The processing activities are performed by OVHcloud for the duration provided in the Agreement.\n\n2. Selection of the Services\n2.1 The Client is solely responsible for the selection of the Services. The Client shall ensure that the\nselected Services have the required characteristics and conditions to comply with the Controller’s\nactivities and processing purposes, as well as the type of Personal Data to be processed within the\nServices, including but not limited to when the Services are used for processing Personal Data that\nis subject to specific regulations or standards (as an example, health or banking data in some\ncountries).

Such assistance will consist of providing transparency about the security\nmeasures implemented by OVHcloud for its Services.\n4.5 OVHcloud undertakes to set up the following technical and organisational measures:\n(a) physical security measures intended to prevent access by unauthorised persons to the\nInfrastructure where the Client’s data is stored,\n(b) identity and access checks using an authentication system as well as a password policy,\n(c) an access management system that limits access to the premises to those persons that\nneed to access them in the course of their duties and within their scope of responsibility,\n(d) security personnel responsible for monitoring the physical security of the OVHcloud\npremises,\n(e) a system that physically and logically isolates clients from each other,\n(f) user and administrator authentication processes, as well as measures to protect access\n3\n\nto administration functions,\n(g) an access management system for support and maintenance operations that operates\non the principles of least privilege and need-to-know, and\n(h) processes and measures to trace actions performed on its information system.\n4.6 These technical and organisational measures are further detailed on OVHcloud Website.\n\n5. Personal Data Breaches\n5.1 If OVHcloud becomes aware of an incident impacting the Controller’s Personal Data (such as\nunauthorised access, loss, disclosure or alteration of data), OVHcloud shall notify the Client without\nundue delay.\n5.2 The notification shall (i) describe the nature of the incident, (ii) describe the likely consequences\nof the incident, (iii) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by OVHcloud in response\nto the incident and (iv) provide OVHcloud’s point of contact.\n\n6. Location and transfer of Personal Data\n6.1 When a Service allows the Client to store Content and notably Personal Data, the location(s) or,\ngeographical area, of the available Datacenter(s) is specified on OVHcloud Website. Should several\nlocations or geographic areas be available, the Client shall select the one(s) of its choosing when\nsubmitting its Order. Subject to any contrary provision of the applicable Special Terms of Service,\nOVHcloud does not modify, without the Client’s prior approval, the location or geographical area\nchosen when submitting its Order.\n6.2 Subject to the foregoing Datacenters’ location provision, OVHcloud and authorised SubProcessors pursuant to section 7 below, may remotely process Client’s Content provided that such\nprocessing operations occur as needed for the carrying out of the Services, and in particular, in\nrelation to security and service maintenance purposes.\n6.3 Concerning the utilisation of Services located in non-European Datacenters, (a) the Datacenters\nmay be located in countries which are not subjected to an adequacy decision of European\nCommission pursuant to article 45 of the GDPR (“Adequacy Decision”) and/or (b) the Client’s Content\nmay, according to sections 6.2 and 7 of this DPA, be processed from countries not subjected to an\nAdequacy Decision.\n6.4 In the event that the Customer uses the Services referred to in the paragraph above for the\npurpose of processing personal Data subject to the GDPR, the Customer is considered as the Data\nController, OVHcloud as its processors and OVHcloud subsidiaries as sub-processors. When personal\ndata is transferred to subsidiaries in countries that do not have an Adequacy Decision, OVHcloud is\nconsidered a Data Exporter and its subsidiaries a Data Importer under the GDPR. In this context,\nOVHcloud and its subsidiaries have concluded standard contractual clauses adopted by European\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 (hereinafter “Standard Contract\nClauses”), annexed to this DPA and intended to apply to the aforementioned transfers.\n6.5 For Services located in datacenters located within the European Union, if the applicable\nConditions of Service provide that the processing of the Personal Data subject to this DPA may be\n\n4\n\ncarried out from one or more countries not benefiting from an Adequacy Decision, the Types of\nContractual Clauses mentioned above apply.\n6.6 In case of Standard Contractual Clauses implementation according to the sections 6.3, 6.4 and\n6.5 of this DPA, the Client is responsible to (i) assess the effectiveness of the Standard Contractual\nClauses (including the relevant technical and organizational measures), taking into account notably\nthe categories of data that the Client intends to process as part of the Services, and the laws and\npractices of the receiving countries, in order to establish if there is anything in the said law or\npractices that may impinge on the effectiveness of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) if the\nassessment reveals that the Standard Contractual Clauses are not effective, implement, as\nrecommended by the European Data Protection Board, any supplementary measure to ensure a\nlevel of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the European Union. OVHcloud\nundertakes to assist the Client by communicating, upon request, any information in his possession\nthat may be useful for the Client’s assessment. Furthermore, the Customer remains responsible for\ncompleting any formality and/or obtaining any authorisation or consent that may, where\nappropriate, be required to enable the transfer of personal data to countries that do not have an\nAdequacy Decision.\n6.7 Any applicable Standard Contractual Clauses shall be supplemented by the other applicable\nConditions of Services (including this DPA) which apply mutatis mutandis to both the Data\nImporter(s) and Data Exporter(s), provided that they do not conflict with the Standard Contractual\nClauses. In case of conflict the Standard Contractual Clauses shall have precedence.\n7. Sub-processing\n7.1 Subject to the provisions of the section “Location and transfer of Personal Data” above,\nOVHcloud is authorised to engage sub-contractors to assist it in providing the Services. As part of\nsuch assistance, the sub-contractors may participate in the data processing activities performed by\nOVHcloud under the Client’s instruction.\n7.2 The list of sub-contractors which are authorised to take part in the processing activities\nperformed by OVHcloud under the Client’s instruction (“Sub-processor(s)”), including the Services\nconcerned and the location from which they may process Client’s Personal Data according to this\nAgreement, is provided (a) on OVHcloud Website or, (b) when a Sub-Processor takes part only to a\nspecific Service, in the relevant applicable Specific Terms and Conditions.\n7.3 If OVHcloud decides to change a Sub-processor or to add a new Sub-processor (“Sub-processor\nChange”), OVHcloud shall notify the Client in its control panel or by email (to the email address\nregistered in the Client Account) (a) thirty (30) days in advance if the Sub-Processor is an OVHcloud\nAffiliate located in the European Union or in a country that is subject to an Adequacy Decision, or (b)\nninety (90) days in advance in any other case. The Client has the right to object to a Sub-Processor\nChange as provided under GDPR. The objection shall be notified to OVHcloud within fifteen (15) days\nfollowing the Sub-processor Change notice by OVHcloud to the Client and specifying the reason for\nthe objection. Such objection shall be notified by the Client through its Management Interface using\nthe category “Data Protection request” or in writing to Data protection Officer, OVH SAS, 2 rue\nKellermann 59100 Roubaix (France). OVHcloud shall in no case be obliged to renounce to a Subprocessor Change. If following a Client’s objection, OVHcloud does not renounce to the SubProcessor Change, the Client has the right to terminate the Services affected.\n\n5\n\n7.4 OVHcloud shall ensure any Sub-processor is, as a minimum, able to meet the obligations\nundertaken by OVHcloud in the present DPA regarding the processing of Personal Data carried out\nby the Sub-processor. For such purpose, OVHcloud shall enter into an agreement with the Subprocessor. OVHcloud shall remain fully liable to the Client for the performance of any such obligation\nthat the Sub-processor fails to fulfil.\n7.5 OVHcloud is hereby authorised to engage third-party providers (such as energy providers,\nnetwork providers, network interconnection point managers or collocated datacenters, material\nand software providers, carriers, technical providers, security companies), wherever they are\nlocated, without having to inform the Client nor obtain its prior approval, to the extent such thirdparty providers do not process the Client’s Personal Data.\n\n8. Client’s Obligations\n8.1 For the processing of Personal Data as provided under the Agreement, the Client shall provide to\nOVHcloud in writing (a) any relevant instruction and (b) any information necessary for the creation\nof the Processor’s records of processing activities. The Client remains solely responsible for such\nprocessing information and instruction communicated to OVHcloud.\n8.2 The Client is responsible to ensure that:\na) the processing of Personal Data as part of the execution of the Service has an appropriate\nlegal basis (e.g., Data Subject’s consent, Controller’s consent, legitimate interests,\nauthorisation from the relevant Supervisory Authority, etc.),\nb) any required procedure and formality (such as data protection impact assessment,\nnotification and authorisation request to the competent data privacy authority or other\ncompetent body where required) has been performed,\nc) the Data Subjects are informed of the processing of their Personal Data in a concise,\ntransparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language as\nprovided under the GDPR,\nd) Data Subjects are informed of and shall have at all the time the possibility to easily\nexercise their rights as provided under the GDPR directly to the Controller\n8.3 The Client is responsible for the implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational\nmeasures to ensure the security of the resources, systems, applications and operations which are\nnot in the OVHcloud scope of responsibility as defined in the Agreement (notably any system and\nsoftware deployed and run by the Client or the Users within the Services).\n\n9. Data Subject Rights\n9.1 The Controller is fully responsible for informing the Data Subjects of their rights, and to respect\nsuch rights, including the rights of access, rectification, deletion, limitation or portability.\n9.2 OVHcloud will provide reasonable cooperation and assistance, as may be reasonably required\nfor the purpose of responding to Data Subjects’ requests. Such reasonable cooperation and\nassistance may consist of (a) communicating to the Client any request received directly from the\nData Subject and (b) to enable the Controller to design and deploy the technical and organisational\n6\n\nmeasures necessary to answer to Data Subjects’ requests. The Controller shall be solely responsible\nfor responding to such requests.\n9.3 The Client acknowledges and agrees that in the event such cooperation and assistance require\nsignificant resources on the part of the Processor, this effort will be chargeable upon prior notice to,\nand agreement with the Client.\n\n10. Deletion and return of Personal Data\n10.1 Upon expiry of a Service (notably in case of termination or non-renewal), OVHcloud undertakes\nto delete in the conditions provided in the Agreement, all the Content (including information, data,\nfiles, systems, applications, websites, and other items) that is reproduced, stored, hosted or\notherwise used by the Client within the scope of the Services, unless a request issued by a competent\nlegal or judicial authority, or the applicable law of the European Union or of an European Union\nMember State, requires otherwise.\n10.2 The Client is solely responsible for ensuring that the necessary operations (such as backup,\ntransfer to a third-party solution, Snapshots, etc.) to the preservation of Personal Data are\nperformed, notably before the termination or expiry of the Services, and before proceeding with any\ndelete operations, updates or reinstallation of the Services.\n10.3 In this respect, the Client is informed that the termination and expiry of a Service for any reason\nwhatsoever (including but not limited to the non-renewal), as well as certain operations to update\nor reinstall the Services, may automatically result in the irreversible deletion of all Content\n(including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other items) that is\nreproduced, stored, hosted or otherwise used by the Client within the scope of the Services,\nincluding any potential backup.\n\n11. Liability\n11.1 OVHcloud can only be liable for damages caused by processing for which (i) it has not complied\nwith the obligations of the GDPR specifically related to data processors or (ii) it has acted contrary\nto lawful written instructions of the Client. In such cases, the liability provision of the Agreement\nshall apply.\n11.2 Where OVHcloud and Client are involved in a processing under this Agreement that caused\ndamage to Data Subject, the Client shall in a first time take in charge the full indemnification (or any\nother compensation) which is due to the Data Subject and, for second time, claim back from\nOVHcloud the part of the Data Subject’s compensation corresponding to OVHcloud’s part of\nresponsibility for the damage, provided however that any limitation of liability provided under the\nAgreement shall apply.\n\n7\n\n12.

In all circumstances, the conditions of this inspection must not affect the security of\nothers OVHcloud’s clients.\n12.4 The aforementioned onsite inspection, as well as the communication of certificates and audit\nreports, may result in reasonable additional invoicing.\n12.5 Any information that is communicated to the Client pursuant to this section and that is not\navailable on OVHcloud Website shall be considered as OVHcloud’s confidential information under\nthe Agreement. Before communicating such information, the Client may be required to execute a\nspecific non-disclosure agreement.\n12.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Client is authorised to answer to competent supervisory\nauthority requests provided that any disclosure of information is strictly limited to what is requested\nby the said supervisory authority. In such a case, and unless prohibited by applicable law, the Client\nshall first consult with OVHcloud regarding any such required disclosure.\n\n13.

The performance of such\nprocessing activities implies a transfer of personal data to the data importer (including remote access from\nits country).\nThe data importer’s country is not considered by the European Commission as a third country that ensures\nan adequate level of protection according to article 45 of the GDPR.\nFor the purposes of Articles 28 (7) and 46 (c) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679,, the parties have agreed on\nthe following Contractual Clauses adopted by Decision n°2021/914/EU dated 4 June 2021 of the European\nCommission, which integrates the clauses of Module 3 applicable to transfers from processor to processor\n(the “Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and\nfundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer\nof the personal data specified in Appendix 1.\nThe following Clauses are only applicable to personal data processing activities performed by OVH SAS and\nthe OVH European Affiliates as processor under their Clients’ instructions entrusted to the relevant data\nimporter as a processor.\n\nSECTION I\n\nClause 1\nPurpose and scope\n\n(a) The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure compliance with the requirements of\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the\n\n9\n\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free\nmovement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) for the transfer of personal data to a\nthird country.\n(b) The Parties:\n(i) the legal persons (hereinafter ‘entities’) transferring the personal data, as listed in Annex I.A\n\n(hereinafter each ‘data exporter’), and\n(ii) the entities in a third country receiving the personal data from the data exporter, directly or\n\nindirectly via another entity also Party to these Clauses, as listed in Annex I.A (hereinafter each\n‘data importer’)\nhave agreed to these standard contractual clauses (hereinafter: ‘Clauses’).\n(c) These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.\n(d) The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of\n\nthese Clauses.\n\nClause 2\nEffect and invariability of the Clauses\n\n(a) These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective\n\nlegal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with\nrespect to data transfers from processors to processors, standard contractual clauses pursuant to\nArticle 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not modified, except to select the\nappropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix. This does not prevent the\nParties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a wider contract\nand/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or\nindirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.\n(b) These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\nClause 3\nThird-party beneficiaries\n\n(a) Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data\n\nexporter and/or data importer, with the following exceptions:\n(i)\n\nClause 1, Clause 2, Clause 3, Clause 6, Clause 7;\n\n(ii)\n\nClause 8.1(a), (c) and (d) and Clause 8.9(a), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g);\n\n(iii)\n\nClause 9(a), (c), (d) and (e);\n\n(iv)\n\nClause 12(a), (d) and (f);\n\n10\n\n(v)\n\nClause 13;\n\n(vi)\n\nClause 15.1(c), (d) and (e);\n\n(vii) Clause 16(e);\n(viii) Clause 18(a) and (b).\n\n(b) Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\nClause 4\nInterpretation\n\n(a) Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have\n\nthe same meaning as in that Regulation.\n(b) These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n(c) These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided for\n\nin Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\nClause 5\nHierarchy\n\nIn the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between\nthe Parties, existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall\nprevail.\n\nClause 6\nDescription of the transfers\n\nThe details of the transfers, and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and the\npurposes for which they are transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.\n\nClause 7\nDocking clause\n\n(a) An entity that is not a Party to these Clauses may, with the agreement of the Parties, accede to these\n\nClauses at any time, either as a data exporter or as a data importer, by completing the Appendix and\nsigning Annex I.A.\n\n(b) Once it has completed the Appendix and signed Annex I.A, the acceding entity shall become a Party\n\n11\n\nto these Clauses and have the rights and obligations of a data exporter or data importer in accordance\nwith its designation in Annex I.A.\n(c) The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising under these Clauses from the period prior\n\nto becoming a Party.\n\nSECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\n\nClause 8\nData protection safeguards\nThe data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is\nable, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its\nobligations under these Clauses.\n8.1\n\nInstructions\n\n(a) The data exporter has informed the data importer that it acts as processor under the\n\ninstructions of its controller(s), which the data exporter shall make available to the data\nimporter prior to processing.\n(b) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the\n\ncontroller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, and any additional\ndocumented instructions from the data exporter. Such additional instructions shall not conflict\nwith the instructions from the controller. The controller or data exporter may give further\ndocumented instructions regarding the data processing throughout the duration of the\ncontract.\n(c) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those\n\ninstructions. Where the data importer is unable to follow the instructions from the controller,\nthe data exporter shall immediately notify the controller.\n(d) The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the same data protection obligations on the\n\ndata importer as set out in the contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law\nbetween the controller and the data exporter.\n\n8.2 Purpose limitation\n\nThe data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as\nset out in Annex I. B., unless on further instructions from the controller, as communicated to the\ndata importer by the data exporter, or from the data exporter.\n\n8.3 Transparency\n\n12\n\nOn request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as\ncompleted by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to\nprotect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data exporter\nmay redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful\nsummary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise\nhis/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the\nredactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.\n\n8.4 Accuracy\n\nIf the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has\nbecome outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data\nimporter shall cooperate with the data exporter to rectify or erase the data.\n\n8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data\n\nProcessing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After\nthe end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data\nexporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the controller and certify to the data\nexporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf\nand delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to\nensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that\nprohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to\nensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as\nrequired under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement\nfor the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the\ncontract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line\nwith the requirements under Clause 14(a).\n\n8.6 Security of processing\n\n(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate\n\ntechnical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection\nagainst a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,\nunauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the\nappropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of\nimplementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in\nthe processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to\nencryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing\ncan be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for\nattributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the\nexclusive control of the data exporter or the controller. In complying with its obligations under this\nparagraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures\nspecified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures\ncontinue to provide an appropriate level of security.\n\n13\n\n(b) The data importer shall grant access to the data to members of its personnel only to the extent\n\nstrictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall\nensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to\nconfidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.\n(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer\n\nunder these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach,\nincluding measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify, without\nundue delay, the data exporter and, where appropriate and feasible, the controller after having\nbecome aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where\nmore information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where\npossible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records\nconcerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the data\nbreach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not\npossible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the\ninformation then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be\nprovided without undue delay.\n(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to\n\ncomply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify its controller so\nthat the latter may in turn notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data\nsubjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data\nimporter.\n8.7 Sensitive data\n\nWhere the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious\nor philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of\nuniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual\norientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data\nimporter shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out in Annex I.B.\n\n8.8\n\nOnward transfers\n\nThe data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions\nfrom the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter. In addition, the data\nmay only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the\ndata importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees\nto be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:\n\n(i)\n\nthe onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;\n\n(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679;\n(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the\n\ncontext of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or\n\n14\n\n(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of\n\nanother natural person.\nAny onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under\nthese Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.\n8.9 Documentation and compliance\n\n(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter or the\n\ncontroller that relate to the processing under these Clauses.\n\n(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data\n\nimporter shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf\nof the controller.\n(c) The data importer shall make all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the\n\nobligations set out in these Clauses available to the data exporter, which shall provide it to the\ncontroller.\n(d) The data importer shall allow for and contribute to audits by the data exporter of the processing\n\nactivities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of noncompliance. The same shall apply where the data exporter requests an audit on instructions of the\ncontroller. In deciding on an audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications\nheld by the data importer.\n(e) Where the audit is carried out on the instructions of the controller, the data exporter shall make\n\nthe results available to the controller.\n(f) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor.\n\nAudits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall,\nwhere appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.\n(g) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of\n\nany audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n\nClause 9\nUse of sub-processors\n\n(a)\n\nThe data importer has the controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s)\nfrom an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the controller in writing of any intended\nchanges to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 90 days in advance,\n\n15\n\nthereby giving the controller sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the\nengagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the controller with the\ninformation necessary to enable the controller to exercise its right to object. The data importer shall\ninform the data exporter of the engagement of the sub-processor(s).\n\n(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf\n\nof the controller), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same\ndata protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms\nof third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this\nClause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that\nthe sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to\nthese Clauses.\n(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s or controller’s request, a copy of such a sub-\n\nprocessor agreement and any subsequent amendments. To the extent necessary to protect business\nsecrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the\ntext of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.\n(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-\n\nprocessor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the\ndata exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.\n(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in\n\nthe event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent\n– the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the\nsub-processor to erase or return the personal data.\n\nClause 10\nData subject rights\n\n(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter and, where appropriate, the controller of\n\nany request it has received from a data subject, without responding to that request unless it has been\nauthorised to do so by the controller.\n(b) The data importer shall assist, where appropriate in cooperation with the data exporter, the\n\ncontroller in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their\nrights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable. In this regard,\nthe Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into\naccount the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope\nand the extent of the assistance required.\n(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the\n\ninstructions from the controller, as communicated by the data exporter.\n\n16\n\nClause 11\nRedress\n\n(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through\n\nindividual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal\npromptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.\n\n(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these\n\nClauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The\nParties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in\nresolving them.\n(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer\n\nshall accept the decision of the data subject to:\n(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual\n\nresidence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;\n(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.\n(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or\n\nassociation under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\n\n(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State\n\nlaw.\n\n(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her\n\nsubstantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nClause 12\nLiability\n\n(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Parties for any damages it causes the other Parties by any\n\nbreach of these Clauses.\n(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive\n\ncompensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor\ncauses the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.\n\n17\n\n(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data\n\nsubject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data\nexporter or the data importer (or its sub- processor) causes the data subject by breaching the thirdparty beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data\nexporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability\nof the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.\n(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by\n\nthe data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that\npart of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.\n(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a\n\nbreach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject\nis entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.\n(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back\n\nfrom the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for\nthe damage.\n(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.\n\nClause 13\nSupervision\n\n(a) The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as\ncompetent supervisory authority.\n(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent\n\nsupervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In\nparticular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the\nmeasures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It\nshall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have\nbeen taken.\n\nSECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES\n\nClause 14\nLocal laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses\n\n(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third\n\n18\n\ncountry of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer,\nincluding any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public\nauthorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based\non the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and\nfreedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to\nsafeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in\ncontradiction with these Clauses.\n(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in\n\nparticular of the following elements:\n(i)\n\nthe specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the\nnumber of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the\ntype of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred\npersonal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data\ntransferred;\n\n(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the\n\ndisclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light\nof the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;\n(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the\n\nsafeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the\nprocessing of the personal data in the country of destination.\n(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its\n\nbest efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to\ncooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.\n(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the\n\ncompetent supervisory authority on request.\n(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses\n\nand for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws\nor practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the\nlaws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such\nlaws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). The data exporter shall\nforward the notification to the controller.\n(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to\n\nbelieve that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data\nexporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to\nensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to\naddress the situation, if appropriate in consultation with the controller. The data exporter shall\nsuspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be\nensured, or if instructed by the controller or the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this\ncase, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the\nprocessing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the\ndata exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless\nthe Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause\n16(d) and (e) shall apply.\n\n19\n\nClause 15\nObligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities\n15.1 Notification\n(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly\n\n(if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:\n\n(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under\n\nthe laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant\nto these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested,\nthe requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or\n\n(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant\n\nto these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification\nshall include all information available to the importer.\n\nThe data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.\n\n(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under\n\nthe laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a\nwaiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon\nas possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to\ndemonstrate them on request of the data exporter.\n\n(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to\n\nprovide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much\nrelevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type\nof data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the\noutcome of such challenges, etc.). The data exporter shall forward the information to the\ncontroller.\n\n(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the\n\nduration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n\n(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause\n\n14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these\nClauses.\n\n15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation\n(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether\n\nit remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the\n\n20\n\nrequest if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider\nthat the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations\nunder international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the\nsame conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer\nshall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the\ncompetent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data\nrequested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are\nwithout prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).\n\n(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for\n\ndisclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the\ndocumentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent\nsupervisory authority on request. The data exporter shall make the assessment available to the\ncontroller.\n\n(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when\n\nresponding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.\n\nSECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS\n\nClause 16\nNon-compliance with the Clauses and termination\n\n(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses,\n\nfor whatever reason.\n(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these\n\nClauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until\ncompliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).\n(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of\n\npersonal data under these Clauses, where:\n(i)\n\nthe data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to\nparagraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in\nany event within one month of suspension;\n\n(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or\n(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory\n\nauthority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.\nIn these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority and the controller of such noncompliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this\nright to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.\n(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to\n\n21\n\nparagraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter\nor deleted in its entirety.

The security team, under the responsibility of the CISO, is itself composed of 4 teams:\nThe security.tools team in charge of developing the security tool used within OVHcloud. This team designs\nand operates the tools to support certain security measures deployed on all OVHcloud information systems.\nThese tools include the management of the identities and accesses of employees and service providers,\nauthentication mechanisms made available to clients, identification of vulnerabilities on systems and\nsecurity monitoring. This team also assists other business teams in the design and deployment of\narchitectures by ensuring security from the definition phase onwards.\nThe security.operations team is responsible for supporting teams in the implementation of good security\npractices within operations, the implementation of formal security management processes, the support in\nthe integration of security tools and the alignment of security devices within OVHcloud. The security.ops\nteam puts in place an internal control system, both organizational and technical on security and assists the\nproduct teams in the implementation of formal information security management systems and in their\ncertification.\nThe security.cert team is responsible for monitoring threat sources, identifying attack tools and methods\nto anticipate them, and managing malicious security incidents. This team manages the OVHcloud CSIRT and\nexchanges with international expert communities to provide the best sources of information to anticipate\nattacks.\nThe security.customer team is in charge of adapting the products offered by OVHcloud to the specific needs\nof specific business sectors (healthcare, finance, etc.). The team values the expectations of these business\nsectors, and coordinates OVHcloud’s response to contractual and standard compliance. It also provides\nlevel 3 support for customer questions about compliance and information security.\nThe security team is accompanied by the physical security management teams and the privacy teams.\nThese three teams work together to ensure optimal effectiveness of actions on these subjects with strong\nadherence.\nIn addition, security referees are deployed within OVHcloud teams. These focal points enable the\ndissemination of good practices within teams, provide an identified point of contact for incident and crisis\nmanagement, and enable the gathering of information from operations to the security team.\nA security committee led by the CISO and the managers of the security team ensures communication with\nthe Executive Committee (ComEx) of OVHcloud. This semi-annual committee presents the main threats\nunder surveillance, the major risks, the monitoring metrics, the progress of the ongoing actions and the\nupdated roadmap. This committee also ensures that the ISSP is aligned with OVHcloud's strategic and\noperational objectives.\nSecurity compliance management\n\nThe ISMS aims to ensure that the security requirements of the various interested parties of OVHcloud\n\n28\n\nare taken into account. These requirements are of different kinds:\n•\n•\n•\n\nlegal or regulatory requirements\ncontractual commitments\ngood practices on which OVHcloud is committed explicitly\n\nOVHcloud must identified and consolidate those requirements and implement the management system in\nsupport for the compliance to these requirements.\nDocumentation\nOVHcloud must deploy a formal documented management system to :\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nprovide a comprehensive framework for policy rules, guideline, operational documentation,\nrecords and indicators\nensure formalism and follow-up of activities implemented to reduce risks\ndemonstrate compliance with applicable legal, regulatory or contractual requirements\ndemonstrate compliance with the rules set out in the detailed security policies\n\nAssets management\nOVHcloud must deploy a formal approach for managing assets carrying security risks or in support for\nsecurity management to ensure appropriate security controls over them:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nMaintain accurate inventories of those assets\nDefine and maintain ownership for those assets\nClassification of those assets based on appropriate criteria to support security decision\nDefinition of security rules adapted to their criticality\n\nSecurity risks management\nOVHcloud must deploy a risk management approach to structure operational decisions affecting security.\nThis risk management approach is based on the principles of ISO/IEC 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005 standards.\nIt is based on:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIn-depth knowledge of systems through asset cartography, asset classifications and valuations from\na security perspective\nOngoing analysis of feared events, vulnerabilities, and the threat environment\nuniform formalization of security risks to make them explicit to technical experts and decisionmakers for reasonable and informed decision-making\nfollow-up of decisions and action plans following the identification of a risk\n\nThe establishment of formal risk management enables the operational specificity of a project or product to\nbe taken into account and the achievement of specific security objectives. Failure to comply with a ISSP rule\nresults in an analysis of the risks resulting from the introduction of compensatory security measures to\nachieve at least an equivalent level of safety or acceptance of risk.\nPrivacy\n\nThe legislation applicable to the protection of personal data and our privacy policy constitute the\n\n29\n\nframework for the processing of this data that OVHcloud applies. ISMS complements this\nframework by consistently defining, implementing, and improving security arrangements that\nensure the protection of hosted personal data.\nThis commitment is reflected in particular in:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe implementation of a Personal Information Management System (PIMS) integrated with ISMS\nSetting up a joint management instance between the security and privacy teams\nAlignment of security and data usage policies\nIntegrating security measures within ISMS into contractual commitments on personal information\nprotection with customers\nThe privacy team's participation in ISMS management\nInvolvement of the security team in efforts to identify privacy risks\nJoint participation in resolving security incidents that impact personal information\nJoint definition of security objectives and measures to be implemented in the context of projects.\n\nCustomer Protection\nOVH implements means of protection on the tools made available to these customers as well as on the\ncommunication channels between them and OVHcloud such as: :\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nCustomer interfaces through the use of identification factors ;\nTools of detection and alerting when customer credentials are used for illegitimate purpose;\nProtection of customer infrastructures and services against external threats\ndata related to customer managed by OVHcloud\n\nMoreover, OVHcloud protects its communications with customers with adequate means according to the\ncontext like encrypted channels, collaborative tools with access and security controls or any other means\ndefined with customers.\nCustomer trust\nOVHcloud must provide the adequate transparency to customer in order the assist them in defining the\nright product for their needs. In particular, OVHcloud must provide information about :\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPhysical location of the data and workloads hosting\nPhysical location of the control plane and administrators\nPhysical location of the support teams\nApplicable law for the service contract\nSupply chain and technical dependencies (Hardware, Software, Subcontractors)\nReversibility capabilities information\nCertification and assurance mechanisms in place\n\nCustomer in cloud security\nOVHcloud must produce a clear definition of responsibilities between OVHcloud and customer:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAssets ownership\nOperations responsibility\nSecurity risk ownership\nRecommendation of security controls to implement by customer with OVHcloud included features\nand configuration\n\n30\n\n•\n\nRecommendation of security controls to implement by customer with optional features or external\nmeans when relevant\n\nSecurity Ecosystem\nOVHcloud must maintain close relationship with security communities to improve the quality of risk\nmitigation and accelerate response time to security threats. Security communities are covering but not\nlimited to :\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nSecurity experts, internally and externally\nSecurity team from hardware manufacturers\nSecurity team of software editors\nOpen source groups\nSecurity software editors\nSecurity professional services providers\n\nExternal technical reputation\nOVHcloud must implement a set of processes to ensure the technical reputation of all systems exposed on\npublic networks, since OVHcloud customers are relying on OVHcloud assets for their own information\nsystem. This covers:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIP reputation to ensure that IP allocated to a customer infrastructure are usable for all legitimate\npurposes\nAbuse process to handle the dispute process when customer infrastructures are used for malicious\nactivities\nAnti-fraud process to ensure all infrastructure usage is legitimate\nAnti-hack process to take down customer compromised infrastructures\nSpam, phishing, malware and dDoS detection and mitigation to protect the public from threats that\nmight be hosted on OVHcloud infrastructure\nProtection and management of all assets under OVHcloud responsibility connected to public\nnetworks\n\nInformation system user\nOVHcloud must protect information and systems by ensuring the information system is adequately\noperated:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nusers are aware of the rules applicable to IS usage\nCompany owned device management\nEmployee owned device management\nAccess to IS from external devices\nCollaborative tools\nWorkstation security\nMobile devices\n\nHuman resources\nOVHcloud must integrate security topic into HR processes to ensure adapted resources are available to\nmeet security objectives. This includes:\n•\n\nsecurity investments and human resources related to security priorities\n\n31\n\n•\n•\n•\n\ndevelopment of roadmaps of other OVHcloud teams to integrate security needs (investment and\nhuman resources)\nskills and training requirements for teams and inclusion in the training plan\nidentifying gaps between needs and available resources for the adaptation of roadmaps and taking\ninto account in risk management.\n\nOVHcloud must educate employees on security as soon as they are integrated and throughout their\npresence in OVHcloud. This awareness is realized by:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIT policy document to define the rules of usage of information system\nOn boarding awareness session for all employees\nFormal threat presentation sessions targeting OVHcloud and security features in place\nRegular communications on good practices and risks\nCommunications focused on a specific threat, related to current events or our detection activities\nTests of the reflexes and the reaction capabilities of the collaborators\nSharing information resources and feedback on cloud threats and vulnerabilities\n\nOVHcloud must manage security in the complete employee life-cycle:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nBackground check fitted to position criticality\nOn boarding management including contractual commitment and awareness management\nSpecific security training depending of position criticality\nRegular awareness session\nDisciplinary process for security violation\nTermination of contract management\n\nIdentity and access management\nOVHcloud must maintain a strict policy of logical access rights management for employees :\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nall employees use nominative user accounts to access any system\ngeneric and anonymous accounts is prohibited for any human access\nauthorizations are issued and monitored by managers, following the principle of least privilege and\nthe principle of gradually gaining trust\nto the greatest extent possible, all authorizations should be based on roles rather than unit rights\na formal, fully auditable process is in place for account creation, modification, deletion and\npassword change\nconnection sessions systematically have an expiry period suited to each application\nuser accounts are automatically deactivated if the password is not renewed after 90 days\npassword complexity is mandatory based on best practices and recommendations from\nauthorities:\no users use automatic password generators rather than choosing their own passwords\no Complexity rules are defined and communicated to all employees, and when possible\ntechnically enforced on systems\no passwords must be renewed regularly, with a maximum of 90 days\nstoring passwords in unencrypted files, on paper or in web browsers is prohibited\n\nOVHcloud must maintain a strict policy of for managing administrator access rights for platforms :\n•\n•\n\nall administrator access to live systems is realized via a bastion host\nadministrators connect to the bastion hosts via SSH, using individual and nominative pairs of public\nand private keys\n\n32\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nconnection to the target system is realized either via a shared service account or via a nominative\naccount and bastion hosts; using default accounts on systems and equipment is prohibited;\ndual-factor authentication is mandatory for remote administrator access and for any employees\naccessing sensitive areas of the system, with such access being fully traced\nadministrators have an account exclusively devoted to administration tasks, in addition to their\nstandard user account;\nauthorizations are granted and monitored by managers, in accordance with the principle of least\nprivilege\nSSH keys are protected by a password that meets the requirements of the password policy\n\nCryptography\n•\n\nUse strong cryptography to secure data at rest and in transit and administration operations.\no Manage cryptographic assets with automated process\no Monitor certificates and keys to ensure all systems have valid certificates at all time\n\nPhysical security\nOVHcloud physical security is based on zoning. Each area within OVHcloud premises is categorized in a zone\ntype dependent from the area usage and the sensitivity of operations and assets hosted. At each zone type,\naccording to it's sensitivity is defined security controls on:\n•\n\nEnvironmental protection against fire, flood, weather conditions our any applicable environmental\nhazard related to premises location\no Monitoring of any malicious or accidental events with automated (CCTV, sensors) or\nhuman (security watch)\no Zone control, with a formal definition of all zones interfaces and gateway\no Access control to ensure only authorized people access each zone for legitimate purpose\n\nSupply Chain\nOVHcloud’s product teams rely mainly on other OVHcloud teams, but also on partners, subcontractors and\nsuppliers to manage operations, and to compose products and services delivered to customers. The match\nbetween the outsourced activities and OVHcloud’s security commitment must be managed:\n•\n\nIdentify dependencies between OVHcloud teams and subcontractors, suppliers and partners\no Classification of criticality dependencies\no Risk analysis and risk reduction where necessary\no Service level cascade and security commitments\no Integrating security into projects\no Security insurance plan for subcontractors\n\nArchitecture\nOVHcloud must ensure that cloud architecture is designed to be and stay secure taking into account the\ncomplexity of information system required to deliver the service, the factorization of information systems\nassets to optimize ressources and the management of several generations of technologies. We rely on\nseveral pillars to achieve this objective:\n•\n•\n\nStrong segregation of systems by criticality\nMutualization of security primitives under the management of security team\n\n33\n\n•\n•\n\nHarmonization of management of specific security assets and processes under common\nmanagement rules\nStrong automation for security deployment\n\nOVHcloud security team maintain a list of basic security architecture guidelines for systems. Architecture\nprinciples must be defined and documented for each type of infrastructure internally. OVHcloud uses\nseveral classification scheme for IT architecture depending of needs.\nExemples of classification:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nTiers 0, Tiers 1, Tiers 2 for internal IS, depending of the internal usage\nMutualized control plane\nProduct dedicated control plane\nCustomer infrastructure (Data plane)\n\nClassification scheme must be used to define the set of security controls to apply according to the threat\nenvironment relevant to the classification characteristics.\nConfiguration and hardening\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nUse OS patterns with system exposure minimization and baseline of security tools\nUse hardened kernels\nFollow best practices for configuration\nDeploy system as code with automated deployment tools\nRegularly review configurations for security\n\nAdministration\nOVHcloud maintain those rules for administration activities:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nall administrator access to live systems is realized via a bastion host\nadministrators connect to the bastion hosts via SSH, using individual and nominative pairs of public\nand private keys\nconnection to the target system is realized either via a shared service account or via a nominative\naccount and bastion hosts; using default accounts on systems and equipment is prohibited\ndual-factor authentication is mandatory for remote administrator access and for any employees\naccessing sensitive areas of the system, with such access being fully traced\nadministrators have an account exclusively devoted to administration tasks, in addition to their\nstandard user account\nauthorizations are granted and monitored by managers, in accordance with the principle of least\nprivilege and the principle of gaining trust\nSSH keys are protected by a password that meets the requirements of the password policy; access\nrights are reviewed on a regular basis, in collaboration with the departments concerned\n\nVulnerability and patch management\nOVHcloud must ensure a systematic deployment of available security patches within a time frame defined\nby system based on its criticality. Vulnerabilities on systems must be identified and evaluated as soon as\nthe associated patch is available. The application of the patch outside the predefined time limit must be\njustified on the basis of the level of risk associated with the corrected vulnerability or the existence of\ncompensatory controls reducing the risk to an acceptable level.\n\n34\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nSystem owners are responsible of vulnerabilities management of their systems\nAssets shall be classified in terms of criticality\nPatch deployment is based on asset criticality and prioritization of patch deployment is based on\nrisk level\nVulnerability mitigation can be achieve without patch deployment, in that case, a complete analysis\nof the situation must be performed\n\nOVHcloud must complete this process by a threat intelligence process and vulnerabilities monitoring to\nensure all vulnerabilities that could put systems at risk are mitigated.\nMonitoring and detection\nOVHcloud must log all records necessary to understand any security events:\n•\n•\n•\n\nlogs are backed up and not limited to local storage\nlogs are consulted and analyzed by a limited number of authorized personnel, in accordance with\nthe authorization and access management policy\ntasks are divided up between the teams responsible for operating the monitoring infrastructure\nand the teams responsible for operating the service\n\nThe list of activities that are logged includes the following:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nlogs of storage servers hosting customer data;\nlogs of the machines managing the customer’s infrastructure;\nlogs of the machines monitoring the infrastructures;\nlogs of the antivirus software installed on all equipped machines;\nintegrity checks of logs and systems, where appropriate;\ntasks and events carried out by the customer on their infrastructure;\nnetwork intrusion detection logs and alerts, if appropriate;\nlogs of network equipment;\nlogs of the infrastructure of the surveillance cameras;\nlogs of administrator machines;\nlogs of time servers;\nlogs of badge readers;\nlogs of bastion hosts.\n\nOVHcloud implement tools and process to ensure:\n•\n•\n\nFast detection of security events to minimize the occurrence of incidents and minimize impacts\nAdapted capabilities to investigate in post mortem\n\nChange management\nOVHcloud must maintain a formal change management principles including security :\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nroles and responsibilities in security are clearly defined\nAll changes are documented in tracking tool\ncriteria for classification are set out in order to identify the security analysis to follow\nthe risks associated with the changes are analyzed (if a risk is identified, the security manager and\nrisk manager work together to validate the change)\nintrusion tests may be carried out (where applicable); the change is planned and scheduled with\nthe customers (where applicable)\n\n35\n\n•\n•\n\nthe change is rolled out gradually (1/10/100/1000) and, if there is a risk, a rollback procedure is\nplanned\na retrospective review of the change is carried out\n\nEach unit within OVHcloud implement its own change management procedure according to this principles.\nProject management\nOVHcloud integrates security within evolution and transformation projects. Compliance with ISSP and data\nprotection is a general requirement for all OVHcloud activities. The security team assists OVHcloud project\nteams in the full lifecycle of all projects to ensure that the security means are adequate and properly\nimplemented. This support consists of:\n•\n\nDetermine the security criticality of the data and processes involved in the project\no Accompany project managers in the definition of technical and functional architecture\no Support project teams in integration into the OVHcloud IS\no Ensure compliance with the security base in the context of the project and the specific\nsecurity measures to be put in place\no Assist sponsors and project leaders in arbitrating specific measures against financial and\noperational constraints\no Evaluate the security level of the project before production phase and after go-live\no Identify residual risks and monitor them over time\n\nIncident management\nOVHcloud deploys a unified approach to security incident management by putting in place the\norganizational and technical means to:\n•\n\nDetect and consolidate events that can impact the security of information systems and services\no Correlate events that indicate a possible breach of information security and trigger\nincident handling as soon as possible\no Mobilize experts and decision-makers in charge of resolving the incident\no Support the incident with the following objectives\n▪ Reduce operational impacts\n▪ Preserve evidences to support possible judicialization or internal sanctions\n▪ Return to nominal situation\no Inform interested parties in accordance with legal and contractual obligations\no Identify root causes, update risk analysis, and define potential action plans to reduce the\nrisk of a new occurrence\n\nNetwork security\nOVHcloud is managing a worldwide backbone to connect all infrastructures hosted in the datacenters and\nlocal networking to ensure the appropriate functioning and administration of the systems. The network\nsecurity relies on:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nsegmentation and segregation of network zones\nall networks equipment's are administered via a bastion host, applying the principle of least\nprivilege\naccess to the administration interfaces and administrator features for equipment is reserved to\nstaff listed on control lists\nNetwork device inventory and automatized management\nManagement of traffic and reaction to specific events\n\n36\n\n•\n\n•\n\nConfiguration of networks devices in terms of networking rules and access control\no Administration of network based on automation. Configurations are deployed\nautomatically, based on validated templates\no Devices configuration are managed in a central configuration repository\no A process is in place for ensuring changes are controlled\nthe logs are collected, centralized and monitored on a permanent basis by the network operations\nteam\n\nContinuity\nContinuity management relies on all mechanisms to ensure Availability, Rescue and Recovery.\nSystems criticality must be defined to determine acceptable Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery\nTime Objective (RTO).\nSystem owners must implement controls to ensure the effectiveness ot continuity mechanisms.\nInternal controls\nFirst-level internal controls are deployed by the operational teams and the security team. These monitoring\nactivities are mainly carried out in the form of:\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nautomated systems monitoring mechanisms\noperational checkpoints integrated into processes to ensure team coordination, risk accounting,\nand possible validations of risky activities. Where possible, these control points are integrated into\nthe tools.\nad hoc operational controls by security experts\n\nSecond-level internal control is carried out by the security teams to ensure the effectiveness of the firstlevel\ncontrols.\nThese\nactivities\nare\nformal.\nThe effectiveness of ISMS is also monitored in the context of steering activities.\nInternal audits\nOVHcloud relies on internal audit approaches to assess the effectiveness of internal control activities. These\naudits are performed by teams independent of audited operations and systems. Internal audit approaches\ninclude:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nOrganizational and technical audit of the rules defined within ISSP\nTechnical audit of architecture review, deployment, project\nSource code audit\nIntrusion tests\n\nThese steps are carried out by OVHcloud personnel or external contractors.\nOVHcloud is implementing a public Bug Bounty program that will enable the permanent testing of our\nsystems exposed on the internet.\nThese activities help identify vulnerabilities, non-conformities and opportunities for improvement and fuel\nthe process of continuous improvement of security.\n\n37\n\nExternal audits\nOVHcloud implements an external audit program on certified perimeters. We rely on:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\ngeneral security framework: ISO 27001, AICPA TSP (SOC)\nCloud Provider-specific security framework: ISO 27017, CISPE, CSA CCM\nrepositories dedicated to specific issues such as privacy: CISPE, ISO 27018, ISO 27701\nindustry or geographical specific security framework: PCI DSS, HDS, PSEE, SecNumCloud, AGID, ENS,\nC5\n\nFor each framework, we determine the most appropriate certification or audit organization to strengthen\nour clients' confidence in our ability to meet the requirements that meet their expectations.\nAudits by customers and authorities\nOVHcloud allows its customers, under certain conditions, to perform security audits on systems.\nSuch audits may be:\n•\n•\n•\n\nTechnical, performed remotely (Intrusion Test, Vulnerability Scan) without OVHcloud teams\nintervention\nOrganizational and technical in asynchronous way through questionnaires and written exchanges\nwith OVHcloud\nOn-site organizational and technical, including installation visits, interviews with operational staff,\nand access to documentation and configurations.\n\nAs with internal and external audits, these evaluations provide input to the security continuous\nimprovement.\nContinuous improvement\nOVHcloud is implementing a continuous improvement of security and management processes.\nOpportunities for improvement are identified by:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nInternal control activities\nInternal and external audits\nSecurity Incident Analysis\nIdentification of security risks\nStakeholders involved in security management processes\nOVHcloud Security Interested Parties\nAnalysis of root causes of non-conformities, vulnerabilities and incidents\n\nThese opportunities for improvement are evaluated before implementation and where appropriate\nprioritized and arbitrated. Consecutive action plans are formally followed in the project management tools\nused by teams\n\nThe processor adopts the same technical and organizational measures as the controller, listed above.\n\n38\n\n", 'name': 'Data_Processing_Agreement', 'url': 'https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_325716a587c64897acbef9a4a4726e38/contracts/5cec77c-OVH_Data_Protection_Agreement-IE-6.2.pdf'}], 'details': [{'cartItemID': None, 'description': '500Mbps unmetered and guaranteed private bandwidth rental -
